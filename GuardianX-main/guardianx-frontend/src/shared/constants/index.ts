/**
 * Resolve the backend API base URL from the build-time VITE_API_URL value.
 *
 * The base URL is the SINGLE place the `/api` prefix is owned; every service
 * calls the shared `api` axios instance with relative paths (e.g.
 * `/auth/setup-status`), so the full request becomes `${API_BASE_URL}/auth/...`.
 *
 * An empty/missing value MUST fall back to a relative `/api` (never an empty
 * string and never an absolute `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` origin). A relative
 * `/api` works through whatever proxy fronts the backend:
 *   - Docker: nginx proxies `/api/` -> backend:8000
 *   - dev:    the Vite dev-server proxy forwards `/api` -> backend:8000
 *
 * If the base URL were empty (e.g. `??` keeps `""`), every request would miss
 * the `/api` prefix (`/auth/setup-status`), 404 at the backend router, and the
 * AuthContext "backend unreachable" fallback would set `initialized=true` —
 * hiding the first-run Setup screen on a fresh install and showing Login
 * instead. Guarding the empty case here is the root-cause fix.
